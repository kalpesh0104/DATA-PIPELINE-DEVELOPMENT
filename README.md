"Description":
“As a data science intern, I wanted to understand how real-world data is prepared before it's used in machine learning or analytics. So, I built a basic ETL pipeline — which means Extract, Transform, and Load. Think of it like cleaning and organizing your desk before starting work. First, I loaded messy data from a CSV file. Then I cleaned it by filling in missing values, converting text into machine-readable numbers, and making sure all numeric values were on the same scale — kind of like translating and tidying everything.
Finally, I saved the clean version into a new file that’s ready for analysis or model building. I used Python with Pandas and Scikit-learn, which are tools that data scientists use every day.
This project taught me how important data cleaning is. Without it, even the best machine learning models won’t work well.”
